# Super Additive

* This is a learning project, going to try to make a synth based on multiple morphing sine waves.
* A journey of a thousand sine waves starts with a single sine wave, so I am starting with the "Biuld a Midi Synth" project here: 
https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_synth_using_midi_input.html
but as a plugin instead of an app.
