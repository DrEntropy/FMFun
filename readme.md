# FM Fun

* This is intended to be a very simple FM synth , probably will be simply 2 op with feedback fm  and a simple ladder filter on the output. It is intended as a learning project to try and escape *tutorial hell*. 

* see the two block diagrams

* TODO:// 
    * Add pitch envelope 
    * Add parameters for envelopes and filters 
    * Add filter envelope 
    * Not sure if i should also add lfo and matrix for that... thinks are starting to get tedious for this demo project!
    * Refactor main oscliator and add second copy- use subtrees?
    * GUI
